### Motivation

Consuming hypermedia means that we have to respect the constraints of self-contained API with one starting point. This tutorial explores a concrete implementation of the todo API that builds a simple todo app.

The tutorial is written using Vue and covers:

* client-side urls and routing
* binding views to representation (through client-side application cache)
* on-demand authentication
* admin view to cloning todos
