Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You made it through the first part of _How To Hypermedia_ and should now be ready to starting building an API and client!

In the following section, you can choose from one of the many hands-on tutorials we created for you. All tutorials will walk you through implementing the hypermedia for the

### Build your own API

Choose your favorite programming language to get started with building an Api:

- [**ASP.NET Core**](https://howtohypermedia.com/aspnet-core/1-getting-started/): You'll build out the API server using ASP.NET Core (on either Windows, Linux or MacOS).

### Learn how to write a client (of the API):

Here's an overview of the frontend tutorials we offer:

- **Vue as a simple client** (_Beginners Choice_): If you're new to hypermedia, this is the tutorial for you. It shows you how easy it is to get started with link relations.
- **Vue**: [Vue](https://vuejs.org) with a client-side application cache to easily make your todo app.
